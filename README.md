# Cryptography

This repostaory will be jounelling my journey and notes throught me exploring crprtography. Hence, marking the beginning of my exploration into the fascinating world of cryptography. Here, I'll document my learning process, and experiments as I delve into the concepts, techniques, and applications of cryptography.


<h2>What to Expect?</h2>

In this repository, you'll find:
1. Notes and summaries of cryptography concepts, including encryption, decryption, hashing, and digital signatures.
2. Resources and references to helpful books, articles, and online courses.


<h2>Why Cryptography?</h2>

Cryptography is an essential aspect of modern computing, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data. As our reliance on digital technologies grows, so does the importance of cryptography in protecting our sensitive information. I shall be exploring from a students prespective to lean and delve furthur and related topics


<h4>HappyÂ learning! :)</h4>
